I‚Äôm Feng, a fourth-year MD-PhD student in the PennSIVE group at the Perelman School of Medicine who is currently working with Dr. Russell (Taki) Shinohara. My research interests include developing novel statistical and machine-learning-based methodology for neuroimaging and other big data settings. So far, I‚Äôve developed tools for multi-modal image analysis, unsupervised MRI segmentation problems, and image harmonization. I‚Äôm particularly interested in leveraging powerful and flexible methods, such as deep learning, in statistically-informed ways and building new methods alongside the scientists who will use them.\nOutside of my methodological work, I‚Äôm interested in teaching biomedical researchers and clinicians how to get the most out of their data in a statistically-sound way, as well as how to interpret studies and clinical trials from a statistical lens. I‚Äôve also served as a statistical consultant for a number of biomedical, clinical, and health informatics projects. If you‚Äôre interested in working together, please send an email! I‚Äôd love to hear from you.\nClinically, I‚Äôm interested in anesthesiology and radiology. I love the mix of diagnosis, medical thinking, ad opportunity for procedure within these specialties.

Previous studies have shown that local covariance structures between modalities, or intermodal coupling (IMCo), can be summarized for two modalities, and that two-modality IMCo reveals otherwise undiscovered patterns in neurodevelopment and certain diseases. However, previous IMCo methods are based on the slopes of local weighted linear regression lines, which are inherently asymmetric and limited to the two-modality setting. Here, we present a generalization of IMCo estimation which uses local covariance decompositions to define a symmetric, voxel-wise coupling coefficient that is valid for two or more modalities. We use this method to study coupling between cerebral blood flow, amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, and local connectivity in 803 subjects ages 8 through 22. We demonstrate that coupling is spatially heterogeneous, varies with respect to age and sex in neurodevelopment, and reveals patterns that are not present in individual modalities. As availability of multi-modal data continues to increase, principal-component-based IMCo (pIMCo) offers a powerful approach for summarizing relationships between multiple aspects of brain structure and function. An R package for estimating pIMCo is available at https://github.com/hufengling/pIMCo.","tags":[],"title":"Voxel-wise intermodal coupling analysis of two or more modalities using local covariance decomposition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Feyisope R.

Objective To examine what types of medical AI have the greatest estimated translational impact (ie, ability to lead to development that has measurable value for human health) potential. Design, Setting, and Participants In this cohort study, research grants related to AI awarded between January 1, 1985, and December 31, 2020, were identified from a National Institutes of Health (NIH) award database. The text content for each award was entered into a Natural Language Processing (NLP) clustering algorithm. An NIH database was also used to extract citation data, including the number of citations and approximate potential to translate (APT) score for published articles associated with the granted awards to create proxies for translatability. Exposures Unsupervised assignment of AI-related research awards to application topics using NLP. Main Outcomes and Measures Annualized citations per $1 million funding (ACOF) and average APT score for award-associated articles, grouped by application topic. The APT score is a machine-learning based metric created by the NIH Office of Portfolio Analysis that quantifies the likelihood of future citation by a clinical article. Results A total of 16‚ÄØ629 NIH awards related to AI were included in the analysis, and 75 applications of AI were identified. Total annual funding for AI grew from $17.4 million in 1985 to $1.43 billion in 2020. By average APT, interpersonal communication technologies (0.488; 95\\% CI, 0.472-0.504) and population genetics (0.463; 95\\% CI, 0.453-0.472) had the highest translatability; environmental health (ACOF, 1038) and applications focused on the electronic health record (ACOF, 489) also had high translatability. The category of applications related to biochemical analysis was found to have low translatability by both metrics (average APT, 0.393; 95\\% CI, 0.388-0.398; ACOF, 246). Conclusions and Relevance Based on this study's findings, data on grants from the NIH can apparently be used to identify and characterize medical applications of AI to understand changes in academic productivity, funding support, and potential for translational impact. This method may be extended to characterize other research domains.","tags":[],"title":"Translatability Analysis of National Institutes of Health‚ÄìFunded Biomedical Research That Applies Artificial Intelligence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fengling Hu","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
